## CyTOF Data (**sent to Alexis to edit**)
Includes preprocessed CyTOF files (FCS format) from a [***]-marker mass cytometry panel to examine CD4 and CD8 T cell memory dynamics in people with HIV (PWH) who are durably (~5yrs) ART suppressed (PWH-ART, n=10) and PWH in the 1.5 years following ART initiation (n=10, ACTG5248). The panel included markers of activation (HLA-DR, CD38, CCR5), activation/exhaustion (PD-1), proliferation (Ki67), survival (Bcl-2) and long-lived memory (CD127).
