## CyTOF Data (**sent to Alexis to edit**)
Includes preprocessed CyTOF files (FCS format) from a [***]-marker mass cytometry panel to examine CD4 and CD8 T cell memory dynamics in people with HIV (PWH) who are durably (~5yrs) ART suppressed (PWH-ART, n=10) and PWH in the 1.5 years following ART initiation (n=10, ACTG5248). The panel included markers of activation (HLA-DR, CD38, CCR5), activation/exhaustion (PD-1), proliferation (Ki67), survival (Bcl-2) and long-lived memory (CD127). 

### Cohort Summary 
1. People with HIV durably suppressed on ART (PWH-ART)
  1. n=10 participants
  2. 3 different timepoints for each.
2. People with HIV in the 1.5 years following ART initiation (ACTG5248)
  1.	n= 10 participants
  2.	12 timepoints for each at days: 0, 2, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28, 56, 84, 140, 252, 504
