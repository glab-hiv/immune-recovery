## Data Folder
Includes CyTOF (.fcs) files from a 32-marker mass cytometry panel to examine CD4 T cell memory dynamics in PWH who are durably (~5yrs) ART suppressed (PWH-ART, n=10) and PWH in the 1.5 years following ART initiation (n=10, ACTG5248). The panel included markers of activation (HLA-DR, CD38, CCR5), activation/exhaustion (PD-1), proliferation (Ki67), survival (Bcl-2) and long-lived memory (CD127). We paired these CD4 T cell studies with functional analysis of T cell proliferative and T cell receptor (TCR) Î² clonotype sequencing.
